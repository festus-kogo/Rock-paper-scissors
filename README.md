### Rock Paper Scissors

If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a *[hand game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_game)* for two or more players. Participants 
say `“rock, paper, scissors”` and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock 
(a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 

The winning rules are straightforward:

- Rock smashes scissors. -> Rock wins
- Paper covers rock. -> Paper wins
- Scissors cut paper. -> Scissors wins
